## Project Overview
This Next.js Dashboard is a clean, modern, and fully functional admin interface built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and a secure authentication flow powered by Auth.js. It includes a responsive layout, dynamic navigation, reusable UI components, and real‑time interactions that make managing data intuitive and efficient. The project is designed with clarity and scalability in mind, making it a solid foundation for future features like analytics, user management, or API‑driven content. The demo video below showcases the dashboard running locally, demonstrating smooth navigation, authentication, and core functionality.
